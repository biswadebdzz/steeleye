What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *

Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.

Install all the necessary libraries using pip

required Libraries:
virtualenv
uvicorn
fastapi
sqlalchemy
pydantic


file structure:
Steeleye:folder name
	__pycache__
	trade-env: virtual environment
	trades: main folder name for APIs
		__pycache__
		__init__.py
		database.py: database file for connecting to sql alchemy(sqlite)
		main.py: used for declaring functions for api
		mainapi.py: used for running fast api ( the main file)
		models.py: used to declare the pydantic models
		schemas.py: used to declare or initialise the database schemas(eg: creating tables)
		requirements.txt: used to install all necessary requirements for running the programs
		trade.db: database file for sqlite


Database.py:

imported necessary libraries for connecting to database
created a variable and assigned the valu of sqlite and created engine and created SessionLocal


main.py:
imported all the necessary libraries
creted all the functions necessary for fetching data and showing data in api


mainapi.py:
imported all the necessary libraries
creted links for apis such as @app.get,@app.post etc.\

models.py:
imported all the necessary libraries 
this file is for creating the pydantic midels

schemas.py:
imported all the necessarfu likbraries 
used to create tables in the dattabse
